Answers to questions from lab.

2. [Explain times for java HashTesting test1].
The higher the skip count is the longer the time will be because there will be more collisions.  With more collisions you hash to the same plaec and you have to iterate through that which takes up time.  That explains the increase in time when N is higher.


3. [Explain times for java HashTesting test2 and test3].
Each string will be hashed to the same constant, this making each one a collision and making test3 slower.




4. [Why does HashSet fail to work in java HashTesting test4?]
Because things that are equal to eachother must have the same hashcode.  But things that have the same hashcode do not necessarily equal the same thing.


5. (Optional) Explain how ListTesting program demonstrates that LinkedLists are doubly linked.
