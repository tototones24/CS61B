start Start playing the current position, if not doing so already (has no effect if currently playing).
	  Takes moves alternately from Red and Blue according to thier color and the current total number
	  of spots on the board: if the spot count plus th eboard size is even, it is Red's move, and if
	  odd it is Blue's move.
	  
quit Exits the program

auto P stops the current game until the next start command and causes the player O to be played by an 
	 automated player (an AI) on the subsequent moves.  The value P must be "red" or "blue".
	 Initially, Blue is an automated player.
	 
manual P stops any current game until the next start command and causes player P to take moves from
	   the terminal on subsequent moves.  The value of P is as for the auto command.  Initially, 
	   Red is the manual player.
	   
size N stops any current game, clears the board to its initial configuration, and sets the size of the
	 board to N squares, where 2 <= N <= 10.  Initially, N = 6.
 
set R C N P Stops any current game.  Put N spots at R and column C.  P is either 'b' or 'r' indicating
	the color of the square.  when N is 0, P is ignored and the square is cleared.  N must be non-negative
	and less than or equal to the number of neigboring squares.
	
dump This command is especially for testing and debigging.  It prints the board.

seed N if you program's automated players use pseudo-random numbers to choose moves, this command sets
	 the random seed to N (a long integer).  This command has no effect if there is no random component
	 to your automated players (or if you don't use them in a particular game).  It doesn't matter 
	 exactly how you use N as long as your autonated player behaves identically each time it is seeded
	 with N.  In the absence of a seed command, do what you want to want to seed your generator.
